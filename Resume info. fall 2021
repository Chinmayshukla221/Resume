CMPE 202
Starbucks:
	Challenges: I didn’t knew java. Workload was too much. 
	Mistakes/failures: Didn’t start the project as soon as possible
Enjoyed: The process was incremental. Solving the testcases gave a good understanding of the design patterns. 
What you’d do differently: Learn java before hand and start the Starbucks project as soon as possible.
Technical portion of the project this project dealt with design patterns, clean code and UML design.
Bad Chess:
	Challenges: Had some problems merging the nodes 
Mistakes/failures: Failed to adequately communicate to my teammates about the progress of my portion of the project. Had some problems using Github.
	Enjoyed: Trying new approaches for building chess and playing with greenfoot.
Leadership: I took initiative of starting and giving a foundation of the project. While coding I tried to implement my code such that it would be easier for my teammates to do their work.
	Conflicts: 
	What you’d do differently: Time management and communication. 
	Technical portion of the project: Design pattern, Agile software development, clean code, software development process and Github
CMPE 245
Made a wireless(ASK and LoRa) and landline setup for jetson nano:
	Challenges: Our group was the first group to try doing the whole project on the Nvidia Jetson nano. Due to lack of documentation and 
	Mistakes/failures: Didn’t consider the voltage of the ASK antenna.
	Enjoyed: The teamwork
	Leadership: I often took initiative for the team meetings.
	Conflicts:
	What you’d do differently:
Technical portion of this project : This project followed IEEE protocol. Implementation of algorithms parts. Developed a synchronization algorithm called a linear invariant synchronous algorithm(LISA). This algorithm was developed to realize the header and payload sync part. Tested ASK communication. Discovered different coding techniques and implemented them in the project.
